                <a href="https://github.com/marcelo-cm">My Github,</a> until
                April 16th, was almost entirely blank. Besides some failed
                attempts to start personal projects, I hadn't yet put all the
                hours I spent on CodeAcademy in practice. Honestly, I thought I
                was pretty good at this frontend thing, until I actually started
                doing frontends. My first startup was less than I had wished,
                but everything I had hoped & expected – I wished for a homerun,
                but I got a couple of singles.

              <p>
                When the band was put together, we did not have an idea. During
                our ideation we explored many many MANY options on what to
                build, but we found that we empathized most with building a
                product that would help creative & productivity-obsessed people.
                We found that the most ambitious, creative & productive people
                are also the ones who find the most trouble with remembering
                everything off the top of their mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                From our research we understood that our key problem to solve
                was... rather large. The human brain is a non-stop thinking
                machine, creating ideas, feeling emotions, making reflections,
                drawing patterns around information & knowledge across a wide
                variety of topics (people, places, situations, projects etc).
                This breadth and density of thoughts make it very hard for
                humans to:{" "}

                Our approach was to solve one aspect of what makes this
                difficult. We use countless tools to organize our lives, which
                is often helpful is retaining information but not in retrieving
                it. Even worse, sometimes organizations system are too hard to
                set up. Our angle was to provide people with a way to:
                <ul className="ml-5">
                  <li className="list-decimal">
                    Store these thoughts quickly, reliably and effortlessly so
                    that they’re not lost with time

                  <li className="list-decimal">
                    Effortlessly organize this information for future use
                  </li>
                  <li className="list-decimal">
                    Enable users to retrieve these thoughts whenever needed so
                    they can take action on them.

                I had designed this from scratch about 5 times, and spent dozens
                of hours each week figuring out how to work through the bugs I
                was experiencing since it was my first time developing a
                product. Unfortunately, all we have now is the Figma designs
                since the product has been updated from this version.

                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/braden-ream">
                  Braden, CEO of Voiceflow,{" "}

                said something really interesting during a fireside chat by
                RippleX Ventures: First-time founders don't think about
                distribution, they often think that if they make a good product
                the users will come. This was largely true for me & my team...
                we had focused too much on the product & not enough on
                identifying our real target market, distribution channels, &
                doing customer discovery to understand whether or not this
                pain-point was worth solving. The result of this was that we had
                no clue who our target persona was – we were too broad. We had
                no one use case we had focused on, instead we tried to tackle
                all spontaneous thought retrieval, enhancement & summary. When
                it was time to craft our GTM, we struggled to nail our story.
                For version 2, we aimed to fix this.
              </p>
              <p>
                A mistake I had made was designing the product without doing
                research on UX for other products similar to ours in user flow.
                Our pages were too complex, the language wasn't clear & it
                wasn't immediately intuitive how to interact with the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                As with many Version 1 products, we have various problems we
                overlooked. Users had a hard time knowing what to ask if they
                didn't come to the platform with questions, but their questions
                were no good if they hadn't already put notes in – we had a
                chicken-and-egg problem, which meant that the activation time of
                our product was three days, and that was far too long.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, during this time the team disbanded because of
                time constraints – John went on to work full-time while Harsh
                decided to pursue other initiatives & start job hunting as well.
                The next steps for me were clear at this point:
                <ul className="ml-4">
                  <li className="list-disc">Simplify the interface.</li>
                  <li className="list-disc">Focus on one use case.</li>
                  <li className="list-disc">
                    Help users with ideas on what to record, and what to ask.
                  </li>
                  <li className="list-disc">
                    Use easy to understand & consistent language.
                  </li>
                  <li className="list-disc">
                    Study products to inform design choices.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>I took these steps & started working on Version 2</p>
            </div>
            <div className="mb-4" id="Version 2">
              <h3 className="text-xs opacity-50">VERSION 2</h3>
              <p>
                After deliberation with the team prior to disbanded, we decided
                that the most common & delightful use case for our users was
                self-reflection. We decided to start tailoring Memoria to this,
                which begged the question of what kind of notes can they provide
                that will enhance this experience. I thought Journalling was the
                best way to do this for a few reasons.
                <ul className="ml-4">
                  <li className="list-disc">
                    There is a target persona & community to target for this use
                    case, which provides much clearer distribution channels.
                  </li>
                  <li className="list-disc">
                    You can journal every day, making it an organic opportunity
                    for retention & stickiness. Shortening the activation period
                    because users would be able to see their results
                    immediately: a quickly capture voice journal transcribed
                    into organize text (We clear & reformat text with AI).

                    Journalling gives us a lot of detail about a users life,
                    which is extremely helpful as context when answering
                    questions surrounding self-reflection.

                    Journalling is an intuitive process: Recapture what your day
                    was about, how you felt about it, etc. Solving our problem
                    where people did not know what to record.

              </p>
              <p>
                To further assist users in recording journals & asking
                questions, I generated a new prompt for them to journal to, or a
                new question for them to simply tap to ask in the chat
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                I then brought on a highschool kid who was interested in
                exploring tech, and we studied various products to understand
                the good and the bad from each journal product's user
                experience, language, and UI. Memoria was then condensed all
                into one screen, merging Create & Ask into one page, and making
                the View page a button on the navigation bar (User interview
                showed that people don't look back into their journals often,
                and when they do it's only for reminiscing & self reflection).
              </p>
              <img
                className="border-8 rounded-3xl my-4 border-[#dedede]/10"
                src={Images.MV2Journal}
              />
              <p>
                On the main page, now called the Journal page, you see both the
                Reflection Bar & the Journalling button. The copywriting was
                changed across the entire product to be clear, descriptive &
                simple. We also provide a prompt to kickstart the users
                journalling, and enable them to even record something at any
                point during the day.
              </p>
              <img
                className="border-8 rounded-3xl my-4 border-[#dedede]/10"
                src={Images.MV2Reflect}
              />
              <p>
                Once a user clicks the Reflection Bar, we open their chat
                interface where they can either ask a question or simply click
                our suggested question to effortlessly start their self
                reflection.

              />
              <p>
                Our view page got a revamp, even though it's less highlighted.
                Filtering became easier, journals became editable after
                submission (previously you could only edit before submitting),
                and sorting became possible. We also introduced the "Time saved
                using Memoria" to show users how much time they saved by
                journalling by voice instead of typing or writing their
                journals.

              <img
                className="border-8 rounded-3xl my-4 border-[#dedede]/10"

              />
              <p>
                A problem with Version 1 was that we had an extremely high
                bounce rate on our landing page – we didn't have anything
                enticing enough for users, and it's also difficult to understand
                the product without someone explaining it you... so I did just
                that, but in a visual format.
              </p>
              <p>
                There were a lot of major changes made, and we have yet to
                go-to-market (GTM) with this new version (though it is live in
                production), but I believe that this should begin to resolve
                many of the pain points users were experiencing, as well as our
                own challenges. This time around we spent much more time on
                research (Product, UX, User) and much more time focusing on the
                details, which I believe is a step in the right direction.

                The data immediately following the update did show this was true
                as well.

              <p>
                My goal is to become a Full-stack developer & Product Manager,
                meaning that I want to be able to understand product development
                from every angle: Business, Design and Tech. Achieving this
                goal, I believe, will position me to be a good founder & have a
                good relationship with the rest of my team because I am able to
                understand the work they are all doing, from first-hand
                experience. Memoria was a grand step towards that direction,
                where I was able to get familiar with front-end & introduced to
                back-end, in practice. The rate of learning by developing a real
                product is ~7x the rate of learning by doing courses & practice
                problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this project, I got great insights into designing,
                optimizing for front-end development processes. I realized how
                vital it is for designer's to have a technical understanding, or
                at the very least, a comprehension of the dynamics involved in
                implementing a front-end. Working alongside two amazing Product
                Managers, I learned how to effectively roadmap, how to best go
                through the ideation process, and got a fresh perspective on
                problem-solving and product assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
                My next product, I'll be able to take all the learnings and
                hopefully achieve a greater impact for others, a greater reach,
                and attain even greater learnings. I want to express my profound
                gratitude to the dedicated team at RippleX Ventures and their
                Fellowship program. Their guidance has been instrumental in
                teaching me essential knowledge about founding companies and
                engaging with venture capital firms & connecting me with a
                community of founders.
